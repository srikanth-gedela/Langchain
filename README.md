# Langchain
Automating Stock Analysis Workflow with Langchain and a Large Language Model

To set up Langchain and utilize a Large Language Model for automating stock analysis, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
2. Create a .env file and insert your own OPENAI_API_KEY in the format: OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxyyyZZZaaabbbCCC'.

Please note that using the application as-is will result in charges to your OpenAI account. 
If you prefer not to incur charges, you can substitute another free-to-use Large Language Model.

To run the application, execute 'streamlit run main.py' in your terminal. 
The app will launch in a web browser on your machine, accessible at localhost:8502.
